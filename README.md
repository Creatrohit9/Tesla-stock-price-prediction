A time series problem is one where any given observation is dependent on the observations made before it. This is pretty simple to think about if you imagine buying groceries. If you go into the store and find that cheese is five dollars more than the last time you bought cheese, you are not likely to find that reasonable. Of course if the price had been increasing gradually for a few months now, you might find its new price to be reasonable (if annoying). Outside factors are likely contributing as well, but for the average buyer, their decision to purchase comes mainly from the prices before. And this need not be only the last few prices.
